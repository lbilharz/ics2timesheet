## ics2timesheet
Extract a time sheet from a calendar file.
### Usage
Export your calendar as an ics file and open it in the file selection dialog.

Select the time range you want the time sheet to be generated on

The time sheet will allow filtering on certain jobs by adding the event in brackets `(` to the title of the calendar event. eg. `JobName (Event)`
