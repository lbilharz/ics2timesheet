Want to run `ics2timesheet` locally? Hereâ€™s how to get it up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed. You can download them from the Node.js official website.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   First, clone the `ics2timesheet` repository to your local machine:

    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary npm packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Server**:
   Run the server using Node.js. If you have Nodemon installed, it will automatically restart the server upon file changes. Otherwise, use `node` to start the server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev  # If Nodemon is installed
    # or
    node server.js  # If not using Nodemon
    ```

That's it! You're now ready to use `ics2timesheet` on your local machine.

### Additional Notes
